# Data Visualisation

There were three coursework assignments for the Data Visualisation module:

	1.	A brief presentation on a choice of data visualisation tool (I chose <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sanddance">Microsoft SandDance</a>).
	2.	A group survey/presentation on a chosen topic (We chose "Uses of music and attachment style").
	3.	Analysis and visualisation of an open source data set (I chose TFL's <a href="http://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/">Santander Cycle Hire Usage Data</a>
	
The latter was the most involved, with the 2016 usage statistics comprising some 9.45 million rows of data. See the PDF report for more details; a couple of nice charts which came out of it are shown below.
