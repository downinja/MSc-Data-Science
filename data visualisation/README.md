# Data Visualisation

There were three coursework assignments for the Data Visualisation module:

	1.	A brief presentation on a choice of data visualisation tool: I chose [Microsoft SandDance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sanddance).
	2.	A group survey/presentation on a chosen topic: We chose "Uses of music and attachment style").
	3.	Analysis and visualisation of an open source data set: I chose TFL's [Santander Cycle Hire Usage Data](http://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/)
	
The latter was the most involved, with the 2016 usage statistics comprising some 9.45 million rows of data. See the PDF report for more details; a couple of nice charts which came out of it are shown below.
