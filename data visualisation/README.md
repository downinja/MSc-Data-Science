# Data Visualisation

There were three coursework assignments for the Data Visualisation module:

	1.	Brief presentation on a choice of data visualisation tool (I chose [Microsoft SandDance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sanddance)).
	2.	A group survey/presentation on a chosen topic (We chose "Uses of music and attachment style").
	3.	Analysis and visualisation of an open source data set (I chose TFL's [Santander Cycle Hire Usage Data](http://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/)
