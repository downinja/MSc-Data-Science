# Data Programming
Data Programming was a module in the first term of the course, primarly an introduction to Python and R.

I'd already had some experience with Python, and Jupyter Notebook, from a Coursera machine learning course. But R was new to me. There were two assignments in this module:

### Assignment 1
Use Python and Matplotlib to perform exploratory analysis on Airbnb listings data for a self-chosen city, from the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) site.

### Assignment 2
Use R to perform exploratory analysis on a dataset of [Mobile phone activity from the city of Milan and the Province of Trentino (Italy)](https://www.kaggle.com/marcodena/mobile-phone-activity/version/1?sortBy=null&group=dataset).
