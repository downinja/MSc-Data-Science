# Machine Learning and Statistical Data Mining
There were three coursework assignments for the Machine Learning and Statistical Data Mining module:

### Assignment 1
Use R to complete selected exercices from the first eight chapters of Hastie & Tibshirani's [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

### Assignment 2
Use R to investigate a dataset of our own selection. I chose to apply [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) to [The musiXmatch Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch), in a preliminary attempt to see if topic modelling techniques could be used to suggest new themes for partially completed song lyrics. 

### Assignment 3
A group project, our task was to replicate the [KDD Cup 2009 challenge](http://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-2009) - in predicting customer behaviour (churn, upselling and appetency) given an anonymised dataset from Orange. This is still ongoing, I'll upload the results once we're done!
